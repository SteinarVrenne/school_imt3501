Data Flow Diagram
-----------------

- Revisit the general architecture you created and the functionalities you defined in theuse cases, then design the system in terms of DFD (Data Flow Diagram)
    - Define the high-level way of disassembling the system and focusing on itsfunctional components, and to analyze the flows of data through the systemcomponents.


Based on the STRIDE-model, we have identified the attack vectors for the different data flows between the processes and/or entities. 

Patient registering for the system poses a threat to the system as the
