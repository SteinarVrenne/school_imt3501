Major threats
=============

- What are the major threats? Focus on threat identification and classification based on:
    - Threat to system/ data confidentially

    - Threat to system/ data integrity

    - Threat to system/ data availability

    - Threat to the system eligible users (actors) authentication

    - Threat to the system eligible users (actors) authorization

    - Threat to the system eligible users (actors) non-repudiation

    - Threat to the system eligible users (actors) privacy


In this section, we will identify potential threats and sources for the
Out-patient healthcare monitoring system. These threats will be identified by
using the STRIDE model as SRIDE per threat. The STRIDE methodology is defined as followed:

.. csv-table::
  :header: **STRIDE letter**, **Definition**, **Violates**
  :widths: 15, 40, 10

	"**S - Spoofing**", "Pretending to be someone or something else.", "Authentication"
  "**T - Tampering**", "Modification of elements you are not allowed to modify.", "Integrity"
  "**R - Repudiation**", "Denying that you did something or claiming that you are not responsible for the event.", "Non-reputation"
  "**I - Information Disclosure**", "Exposing information to someone who is not authorized.", "Confidentiality"
  "**D - Denial of Service**", "Preventing a system from providing a service or preventing users to access it.", "Availability"
  "**E - Elevation of privileges**", "Refers to situations where you are able to perform actions you are not supposed to.", "Authorization"
