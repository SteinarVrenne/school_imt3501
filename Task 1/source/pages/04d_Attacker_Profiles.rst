Identify and specify the main potential attacker profiles who would attack the system
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A website with a lot of personal information, and health records like this could
potentially attract a lot of attention from state nations, as well as individuals who
wants to know a persons health status. We can divide the potential attackers
into two groups, based on their intentions: financially motivated, and
information gathering

Information gathering
"""""""""""""""""""""

Within this information gathering part, I will divide the attacker profiles into
two main categories:

Foreign countries 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
National state that want so abuse the health situation of an individual, in
order to gain information or power. They have a lot of resources, funding, and
knowledge, which makes a real threat to any platform, including ours. There are
multiple occurrences where foreign countries / nation states have targeted other
countries health care records. One good example of this was in 2018, a total of
1.5 million people were affected by an attack on Singapore’s health data.
Medical prescriptions for 160,000 persons were stolen, including the
prescriptions to the prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, how was the attackers main
goal. It is stated that the attack are believed to be state-sponsored, which
clearly has a political focus to embarrass or compromise the individual. The
prime minister stated himself that: "I don’t know what the attackers were hoping
to find. Perhaps they were hunting for some dark state secret, or at least
something to embarrass me." [1]_




In Norway, we had the hack on "Helse sør-øst", in which attackers outside Norway
gained access to the database systems, which held all of the personal
information. It is not clear what information which were extracted from the servers,
although the one thing we know, is that a state actor were behind.

Individuals or groups 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Someone that want so know a public figures health record. Maybe expose something
that is not publicly know, in order to change peoples opinion of that person. In
april, a 16 year old boy in Madrid hacked into the health service records, and
obtained patients medical records. One of this records belongs to a local
politician, who it turns out had tested positive for Covid-19. The intention are
not known, however information like this can be used to weaken peoples opinion
about others. [2]_



Financially motivated
"""""""""""""""""""""

On the dark web, health records are worth a fortune. One patients record can
sell for sometimes the amount of $1000, as of how much information the record
contains, which can be as much as:

    - Full name
    - Data of birth
    - Education
    - Social security number
    - Email
    - Credit card information
    - Address
    - Prescriptions
    - Phone number
    - Insurance details

With this information, a potential buyer are able to take loans under the
persons name or purchase drugs. The attackers who are financially motivated, are
individuals or groups who seek to earn quick and easy money. They don't use the
most advanced methods of gaining access to the systems, because hospitals
usually don't have a good security policy.
