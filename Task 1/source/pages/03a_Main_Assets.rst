Main Assets
===========
The main assets we have identified are crucial for the organization/hospital. First, we have the authentication server/system which will authenticate incoming requests. Next, we have the system administrators, whom are responsible for authenticating healthcare workers in the system. 

Users of the system, such as patients, healthcare workers and social workers are also assets of the system, as they generate the data that is most vital to the system. Breaking this trust to the customers, would affect the system and hospitals credibility. 

Credibility is an identified asset, because it would cause a disruption to the organizations ability to perform its task. 

The Electronic Health Registry (EHR) is also vital to the organization. A disruption in this tool will prevent the healthcare personnel from doing their work and help patients.
