Main Assets
===========
The main assets we have identified are crucial for the organization. First, we have the authentication server/system which
will authenticate incoming requests. Next, we have the system administrators, whom are responsible for authenticating healthcare
workers in the system. 
Users of the system, such as patients, healthcare workers and social workers are also assets of the system, as they generate 
the data that is most vital to the system. Breaking this trust to the customers, would destroy the systems credibility
