1.Read and understand the case study
------------------------------------

2.Identify the business goals of the system
-------------------------------------------

The Out-patient Healthcare Monitoring system wish to build a healthcare
monitoring system for patients that are discarded and returned home from the
organization. This way healthcare workers might watch and followup on their
patients health status. It is also important for the business that the patients
to be able to communicate with the healthcare workers in order to update their

- Communication between patients and healthcare workers via. mobile application.
- Healthcare workers should be able to find/"edit?" information about the patients.
